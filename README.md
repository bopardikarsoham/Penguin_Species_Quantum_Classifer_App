# Classification of Penguins using a Quantum Support Vector Machine
In this project I have created a Quantum Machine Learning Model that can classify the species of Palmer Penguins on the basis of their features present in this dataset(https://www.kaggle.com/ashkhagan/palmer-penguins-datasetalternative-iris-dataset?select=penguins.csv).

## Palmer Penguins Dataset
The goal of palmerpenguins is to provide a great dataset for data exploration & visualization. It is sometimes considered an alternative to the Iris Dataset.

## Here are the Palmer Penguins!

## About the data
Data were collected and made available by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER, a member of the Long Term Ecological Research Network.
